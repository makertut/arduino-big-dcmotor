DC Motor Driver
Motor Drive Module (BTS7960) - 43A with H-Bridge

The IBT-2 is a fully integrated high current H bridge for motor drive applications using the Infineon BTS7960 high current half bridge. the BTS7960 is part of the NovalithICTM family containing one p-channel highside MOSFET and one n-channel lowside MOSFET with an integrated driver IC in one package. Due to the p-channel highside switch the need for a charge pump is eliminated thus minimizing EMI.

Interfacing to a microcontroller is made easy by the integrated driver IC which features logic level inputs, diagnosis with current sense, slew rate adjustment, dead time generation and protection against overtemperature, overvoltage, undervoltage, overcurrent and short circuit.
The IBT-2 provides a cost optimized solution for protected high current PWM motor drives with very low board space consumption.
